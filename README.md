# 🌸 Iris Dataset - Complete Data Analysis & Machine Learning Pipeline

This project presents an end-to-end data science workflow using the classic **Iris flower dataset**, showcasing both **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning techniques along with rich visualizations and statistical analysis.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset in the machine learning community, containing 150 samples of iris flowers from three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. Each sample includes 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In this project, I performed:

- ✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- ✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- ✅ **Data Visualization**
- ✅ **Statistical Analysis**
- ✅ **Supervised Learning (Linear Regression - 100% Accuracy)**
- ✅ **Model Interpretation**
- ✅ **Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)**
- ✅ **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA Visualization)**
- ✅ **Model Comparison & Evaluation**

## 📊 Workflow Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning / Preprocessing
- Checked for nulls and duplicates.
- Renamed columns and converted data types as needed.
- Normalized/Standardized data where required.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics.
- Feature distributions & correlations.
- Species-wise feature separation.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Histograms, Pairplots, Boxplots.
- Heatmaps for correlation.
- Cluster visualization using K-Means & PCA.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
- Mean, Median, Mode.
- Correlation Matrix.
- Outlier Detection.

### 5. Model Application – Linear Regression
- Applied linear regression for feature prediction.
- Achieved **accuracy of 1.00** (perfect fit on training/test split).
- Evaluated using metrics like R² score and MSE.

### 6. Model Interpretation
- Analyzed coefficients.
- Visualized actual vs predicted outcomes.
- Feature importance through regression weights.

### 7. K-Means Clustering
- Applied unsupervised learning to classify data points.
- Compared predicted clusters vs actual species labels.
- Visualized clusters with colors.

### 8. PCA Visualization
- Reduced features to 2D.
- Plotted PCA-transformed data.
- Highlighted how well PCA separates the species visually.

### 9. Comparison
- Compared clustering and supervised learning.
- Visual assessment & statistical comparison of prediction accuracy.
